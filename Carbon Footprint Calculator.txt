Carbon Footprint Calculator

A basic tool to estimate carbon emissions from Energy, Waste, and Travel activities.

How It Works
Provide basic data in three categories:

Energy: Enter your monthly electricity, gas, and fuel expenses.

Waste: Input your monthly waste production and recycling percentage.

Travel: Provide annual travel distance and vehicle fuel efficiency.

Usage Example

Input:

Name: Dhruvin Kheni
Year: 2024
Electricity Cost: €60/month
Gas Cost: €40/month
Fuel Cost: €30/month
Monthly Waste: 45 kg
Recycling Rate: 50%
Annual Travel: 10,000 km
Fuel Efficiency: 8 L/100km

Output:
Energy Emissions: 500 kg CO₂
Waste Emissions: 30 kg CO₂
Travel Emissions: 2,800 kg CO₂

Total Emissions: 3,330 kg CO₂

This simplified approach provides a quick overview of your carbon footprint and encourages sustainable choices.
